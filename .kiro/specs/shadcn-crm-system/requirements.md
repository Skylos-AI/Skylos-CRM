# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a shadcn-based CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system frontend. The system will provide a simplified Kommo-style interface focused on lead management through a kanban board, with additional modules for company and contact management. The frontend will be built using Next.js 13, shadcn/ui components, and TailwindCSS, designed to eventually integrate with a backend API while initially using mock data for development.
