# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create smooth minimalist chart styling system



  - Implement monochromatic color palette using black (#000000), white (#ffffff), and light grey (#f3f4f6, #e5e7eb, #9ca3af) from existing design system
  - Create smooth rounded chart elements with no sharp edges using border-radius utilities (rounded-xl, rounded-2xl, rounded-full)

  - Remove visual clutter by eliminating grid lines, using minimal axis labels, and clean typography
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_

- [x] 2. Implement responsive grid layout prioritizing revenue (ROI/finance)





  - Create CSS Grid layout where revenue chart takes 60% of space (col-span-3 of 5 total columns)
  - Position revenue chart prominently in top-left or center-top area for maximum visibility
  - Use clean white card backgrounds with subtle rounded corners (rounded-xl) and minimal shadows
  - Implement responsive breakpoints that maintain revenue chart prominence on all screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [x] 3. Create smooth circular revenue chart as primary metric



  - Transform revenue area chart to use smooth curved lines (type="monotone") with no sharp angles
  - Apply subtle grey gradient fill (from light grey #f3f4f6 to transparent) for clean visual appeal
  - Remove all grid lines and axis lines, keeping only essential data points with circular markers
  - Add smooth hover animations with circular tooltips showing revenue data in clean typography
  - Use large, bold typography for revenue values with minimal supporting text in light grey
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 4. Build smooth unified performance chart with clean time selection



  - Create single consolidated line chart with smooth curved lines (no sharp angles) combining leads, deals, and conversion
  - Implement minimalist time period selector using clean button group (Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly/Yearly) with subtle grey borders
  - Use different line weights (stroke-width: 1, 2, 3) instead of colors to differentiate metrics in monochromatic style
  - Add smooth fade transitions between time periods with circular data point markers
  - Remove all visual clutter: no grid lines, minimal axis labels, clean white background
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 5. Create smooth rounded pipeline bars with minimal styling


  - Transform pipeline bars to use fully rounded corners (rounded-full) for smooth, pill-shaped appearance
  - Apply monochromatic styling using different shades of grey (#f3f4f6, #e5e7eb, #d1d5db, #9ca3af) for each stage
  - Remove all borders and sharp edges, use subtle spacing between bars for clean separation
  - Add smooth hover effects with circular tooltips containing essential stage information only
  - Use clean typography hierarchy: bold stage names, light grey supporting metrics
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 6. Design smooth circular priority distribution chart



  - Create modern donut chart with thick, smooth circular segments and no sharp edges
  - Use monochromatic grey scale (lightest to darkest grey) instead of colors for priority levels
  - Add clean center display with large typography showing total count and key metric
  - Remove traditional legend, use subtle labels directly on or near chart segments
  - Implement smooth hover animations with circular expansion effects
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 7. Create smooth loading states with minimal visual elements



  - Build clean skeleton loaders using rounded rectangles (rounded-xl) with subtle grey shimmer animation
  - Design minimalist error states with simple icons and clean typography on white backgrounds
  - Create empty state displays with subtle illustrations and helpful guidance text in light grey
  - Implement smooth fade-in animations for chart loading with circular progress indicators
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5_

- [x] 8. Implement accessibility with clean visual focus indicators





  - Add ARIA labels for all chart elements using descriptive text for screen readers
  - Create smooth circular focus indicators (rounded-full) for keyboard navigation
  - Implement high contrast mode support maintaining the monochromatic design
  - Add reduced motion preferences support while keeping smooth transitions for users who prefer them
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [x] 9. Optimize performance with smooth rendering





  - Implement React.memo and useMemo for chart data processing to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Add smooth debounced updates for user interactions (hover, selection) with 150ms delay
  - Create efficient data caching for time period calculations with smooth transition animations
  - Optimize bundle size by lazy loading chart components with smooth loading transitions
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_
