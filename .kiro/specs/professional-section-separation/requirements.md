# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the implementation of professional section separation improvements for the landing page. The enhancement focuses on creating subtle, professional visual separation between sections through background color alternation, clear section titles with badges, enhanced typography, and soft background elements. The goal is to eliminate harsh separator lines while maintaining clear visual hierarchy and professional aesthetics that guide users through the content flow.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a user scrolls to the problem section THEN the system SHALL display a light slate background (bg-slate-50)
3. WHEN a user views the solution section THEN the system SHALL display a clean white background (bg-white)
4. WHEN a user scrolls to the process section THEN the system SHALL display a light slate background (bg-slate-50)
5. WHEN a user reaches the CTA section THEN the system SHALL display a blue background (bg-blue-600)
6. IF the user is on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain the same background alternation pattern with proper responsive behavior

### Requirement 2: Professional Section Title System

**User Story:** As a user reading the landing page, I want to see clear section identification through professional badges and enhanced typography, so that I can quickly understand the content structure and navigate the information hierarchy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN a user examines section badges THEN the system SHALL use black background with white text for clear section identification
4. WHEN sections are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent padding and margins for professional hierarchy
5. IF the content is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt typography and badge sizing appropriately

### Requirement 3: Subtle Background Elements Integration

**User Story:** As a visitor experiencing the landing page, I want to see soft, professional background elements that add visual interest without distraction, so that the page feels polished and engaging while maintaining focus on the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views sections THEN the system SHALL display thin, subtle gradient lines at the top and bottom of sections where appropriate
2. WHEN background elements are rendered THEN the system SHALL include soft, transparent circles as floating shapes for visual interest
3. WHEN sections transition THEN the system SHALL ensure no harsh separator lines are visible between content areas
4. WHEN visual elements are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain subtle opacity levels that don't compete with content readability
5. IF animations are enabled THEN the system SHALL provide gentle movement or parallax effects for background elements without performance impact

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Visual Hierarchy Implementation

**User Story:** As a user scanning the landing page content, I want to experience a clear visual hierarchy that guides my attention through the information, so that I can quickly understand the key messages and take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views section content THEN the system SHALL use black section badges for clear section identification and navigation
2. WHEN headlines are displayed THEN the system SHALL use strong black text (text-black) for maximum contrast and readability
3. WHEN spacing is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent professional padding and margins throughout all sections
4. WHEN accent colors are used THEN the system SHALL limit accents to soft blue highlights that complement the professional aesthetic
5. IF users interact with elements THEN the system SHALL provide subtle feedback that maintains the professional visual hierarchy

### Requirement 5: Seamless Section Flow Experience

**User Story:** As a potential client scrolling through the landing page, I want to experience smooth, professional transitions between sections, so that I can focus on the content without jarring visual interruptions that break my reading flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls between sections THEN the system SHALL provide smooth background color transitions without harsh boundaries
2. WHEN section changes occur THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent typography and spacing that creates visual continuity
3. WHEN background elements are visible THEN the system SHALL ensure they enhance rather than distract from the content flow
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL render all section separations immediately without layout shifts or flashing
5. IF the user scrolls quickly THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth visual transitions without performance degradation

### Requirement 6: Mobile-Responsive Professional Design

**User Story:** As a mobile user accessing the landing page, I want to experience the same professional section separation and visual hierarchy, so that I can have a consistent, high-quality experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a mobile user views sections THEN the system SHALL maintain the background color alternation pattern with appropriate mobile spacing
2. WHEN section badges are displayed on mobile THEN the system SHALL scale appropriately while maintaining readability
3. WHEN typography is rendered on mobile THEN the system SHALL adjust font sizes to maintain hierarchy while ensuring readability
4. WHEN background elements are shown on mobile THEN the system SHALL optimize for touch interfaces and smaller screens
5. IF the device orientation changes THEN the system SHALL maintain professional section separation in both portrait and landscape modes

### Requirement 7: Performance and Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As any user accessing the landing page, I want the professional section separation enhancements to load quickly and be accessible, so that I can have a smooth experience regardless of my technical setup or accessibility needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL render section separations without impacting Core Web Vitals scores
2. WHEN background elements are displayed THEN the system SHALL use CSS-optimized techniques that don't block rendering
3. WHEN color changes are implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios for all text elements
4. WHEN animations are present THEN the system SHALL respect user preferences for reduced motion
5. IF screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate semantic structure that doesn't interfere with content navigation
