# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on enhancing the user experience and visual design of the CRM system's leads management and dashboard areas. The improvements will follow established UI/UX principles to create a more intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing interface that reduces cognitive load and improves user productivity. The enhancements will address information hierarchy, visual consistency, interaction patterns, and overall usability while maintaining the existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Dashboard Information Hierarchy

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want the dashboard to clearly prioritize the most important information and actions, so that I can quickly understand my business performance and take appropriate actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display KPI cards with clear visual hierarchy using size, color, and positioning

3. WHEN displaying recent activity THEN the system SHALL use visual cues (icons, colors, typography) to distinguish between different activity types
4. WHEN showing upcoming follow-ups THEN the system SHALL highlight overdue items with appropriate visual urgency indicators
5. IF there are no upcoming follow-ups THEN the system SHALL display a meaningful empty state with actionable guidance

### Requirement 2: Improved Lead Card Visual Design

**User Story:** As a sales representative, I want lead cards to be visually scannable and informative, so that I can quickly assess lead priority and status without opening detailed views.

5. WHEN displaying contact information THEN the system SHALL truncate appropriately while maintaining readability
6. WHEN showing tags and badges THEN the system SHALL limit visual clutter while preserving important information
7. WHEN viewing lead cards THEN the system SHALL display cards with adequate width to prevent block-like appearance and ensure proper card proportions
8. WHEN displaying lead cards THEN the system SHALL use elevated card design with proper shadows, rounded corners, and white space to create distinct card appearance rather than flat information blocks

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Kanban Board Usability

**User Story:** As a sales manager, I want the kanban board to provide clear visual feedback and smooth interactions, so that I can efficiently manage leads through the sales pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dragging lead cards THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback with appropriate hover states and drag indicators
2. WHEN dropping cards in columns THEN the system SHALL show clear drop zones with visual boundaries
3. WHEN viewing column headers THEN the system SHALL display stage information with consistent color coding and clear typography
4. WHEN columns contain many leads THEN the system SHALL implement proper scrolling with visual indicators
5. WHEN the board is loading THEN the system SHALL show skeleton states that match the final layout structure
6. WHEN drag operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error feedback and revert to previous state
7. WHEN viewing kanban columns THEN the system SHALL display prominent stage colors at the top of each column header (incoming leads/decision making/negotiation/final decision) rather than on individual card borders
8. WHEN displaying lead cards within columns THEN the system SHALL show only subtle color indicators that reference the column's primary color while maintaining card readability and visual hierarchy

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Dark Theme and Visual Separation

**User Story:** As a CRM user working in dark mode, I want a sophisticated color palette with proper visual separation between interface elements, so that I can work comfortably for extended periods without visual strain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using dark theme THEN the system SHALL implement a layered color system using multiple shades of grey (slate-950, slate-900, slate-800, slate-700) for different interface levels
2. WHEN displaying the sidebar THEN the system SHALL use soft rounded corners and subtle color transitions instead of sharp edges for visual separation
3. WHEN showing data containers and cards THEN the system SHALL provide clear border definition using either subtle border colors (slate-700/slate-600) or soft glow effects
4. WHEN separating interface sections THEN the system SHALL use gradient transitions or soft shadows instead of hard lines
5. WHEN displaying nested content THEN the system SHALL create visual depth using progressive background colors (darker to lighter or vice versa)
6. WHEN showing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL use soft hover states with gentle color transitions and subtle elevation changes

### Requirement 5: Consistent Visual Design System

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want all interface elements to follow consistent design patterns, so that I can navigate and use the system intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any interface element THEN the system SHALL use consistent spacing based on a 4px grid system
2. WHEN displaying buttons and interactive elements THEN the system SHALL maintain uniform corner radii, padding, and hover states
3. WHEN showing status indicators THEN the system SHALL use conventional colors (red for urgent/error, green for success, yellow for warning)
4. WHEN displaying typography THEN the system SHALL limit font families to 1-2 readable options with clear hierarchy
5. WHEN showing form elements THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling and validation patterns
6. WHEN using icons THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent sizing, stroke width, and visual weight

### Requirement 6: Improved Accessibility and Contrast

**User Story:** As a user with visual impairments, I want the interface to meet accessibility standards, so that I can effectively use the CRM system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing text content THEN the system SHALL maintain minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
2. WHEN displaying interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear focus indicators and keyboard navigation
3. WHEN using color to convey information THEN the system SHALL include additional visual cues (icons, text, patterns)
4. WHEN showing status information THEN the system SHALL not rely solely on color to communicate meaning
5. WHEN displaying form fields THEN the system SHALL provide clear labels and error messages

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Loading and Empty States

**User Story:** As a CRM user, I want clear feedback when content is loading or unavailable, so that I understand the system status and know what actions to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL display skeleton screens that match the final content structure
2. WHEN no data is available THEN the system SHALL show meaningful empty states with helpful illustrations and actionable guidance
3. WHEN operations are processing THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback with appropriate loading indicators
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with recovery options
5. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL offer retry mechanisms with clear instructions

### Requirement 8: Mobile-Responsive Design Improvements

3. WHEN showing data containers and cards THEN the system SHALL provide clear border definition using subtle border colors (gray-200/gray-300) and soft shadows on light grey backgrounds
4. WHEN separating interface sections THEN the system SHALL use gradient transitions from light grey tones instead of hard white-to-white transitions
5. WHEN displaying nested content THEN the system SHALL create visual depth using progressive light grey backgrounds (gray-50 to gray-100 to gray-200)
6. WHEN showing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL use soft hover states with gentle grey color transitions and subtle elevation changes
