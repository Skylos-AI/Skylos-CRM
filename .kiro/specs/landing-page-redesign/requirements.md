# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the redesign of the agency's landing page to create a minimalistic, story-driven experience that effectively communicates the value proposition of fully customized conversational AI agents for business automation. The redesign emphasizes the streamlined, nearly completed implementation process that can be tailored to specific business needs while maintaining competitive maintenance costs. The page leverages FOMO around AI automation adoption and positions conversational AI systems as the next evolutionary step in business automation, focusing on how the custom agent creation process directly addresses key business pain points throughout development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads the page THEN the system SHALL achieve a page load time under 3 seconds on standard connections
2. WHEN a user accesses the page on any device THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive experience optimized for that screen size
3. WHEN a user with accessibility needs visits THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards
4. WHEN animations are running THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance without blocking user interactions
5. IF a user has slow internet THEN the system SHALL progressively load content while maintaining core functionality

### Requirement 6: AI Automation FOMO and Conversational System as Next Step

**User Story:** As a potential client reading the landing page content, I want to feel the urgency of AI automation adoption and understand how the conversational part of our system represents the next step in this evolution, so that I don't miss out on competitive advantages and can see the advanced nature of the solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads the main headline THEN the system SHALL create strong FOMO around AI automation adoption, emphasizing competitors are already gaining advantages
