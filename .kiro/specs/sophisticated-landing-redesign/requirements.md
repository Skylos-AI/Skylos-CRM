# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the creation of a sophisticated landing page that showcases AI implementation and custom development services for businesses. The page achieves refined minimalism while being visually compelling, emphasizing how businesses can integrate AI solutions through custom development. The design uses creative, asymmetrical layouts with strategic white space, subtle animations, and typography-driven design to communicate the value of AI implementation for business transformation. The page must strictly adhere to a specific color palette and implement sophisticated interactive elements that create engagement without being overwhelming.
